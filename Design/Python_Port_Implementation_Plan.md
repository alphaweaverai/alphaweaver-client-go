### Folder Monitoring & File Processing

The ClientGUI monitors multiple folders and processes various file types as part of the Alpha Weaver job execution workflow:

#### Monitored Folders
**Jobs Folders** (`C:\AlphaWeaver\Files\jobs\`):
- `to_do/` - Downloads job XML files from server for TSClient processing
- `in_progress/` - Jobs currently being processed by TSClient
- `done/` - Successfully completed jobs
- `error/` - Jobs that failed processing

**Results Folders** (`C:\AlphaWeaver\Files\results\`):
- `to_do/` - Monitors for CSV trade files from TSClient (uploaded to server)
- `done/` - Successfully uploaded result files
- `temp/` - Temporary processing files
- `csv/` - CSV result files storage
- `trades/` - Trade data files

**Optimization Folders** (`C:\AlphaWeaver\Files\opt\`):
- `in/` - Monitors for .opt optimization result files from TSClient
- `done/` - Successfully uploaded optimization files
- `error/` - Failed optimization file uploads
- `summary/` - Monitors for *_Daily.rep daily summary JSON files from TSClient

#### Processed File Types
- **Job XML Files**: Downloaded from server, processed by TSClient to generate results
- **CSV Files**: Trade data generated by TSClient, uploaded to server
- **OPT Files**: Optimization results (.opt) from TSClient, compressed and uploaded
- **Daily Summary Files**: JSON files (*.rep) containing daily performance metrics, uploaded to server

#### File Processing Actions by Folder

**Jobs Folders**:
- `to_do/`: ClientGUI downloads job XML files here (no processing by ClientGUI - handled by TSClient)
- `in_progress/`: TSClient moves jobs here during processing (ClientGUI tracks for statistics)
- `done/`: TSClient moves completed jobs here (ClientGUI tracks for statistics)
- `error/`: TSClient moves failed jobs here (ClientGUI tracks for statistics)

**Results Folders**:
- `to_do/`: **Monitors for CSV files** → Extracts symbol/timeframe from filename (format: `symbol_timeframe_*.csv`) → Uploads to `upload-csv-results` API → Moves to `done/` on success or leaves for retry on failure
- `done/`: Successfully uploaded CSV files (tracked for statistics)
- `temp/`: Temporary files during processing (cleanup operations)
- `csv/`: Storage for CSV result files
- `trades/`: Trade data files storage

**Optimization Folders**:
- `in/`: **Monitors for .opt files** → Parses zlib-compressed OPT file → Extracts job ID/symbol/timeframe from filename → Uploads to `upload-opt-results` API → Checks for WFO processing → Triggers daily summary scan → Moves to `done/` on success
- `done/`: Successfully uploaded OPT files
- `error/`: Failed OPT upload attempts
- `summary/`: **Monitors for *_Daily.rep files** → Extracts job ID from filename (format: `jobid_symbol_timeframe_Daily.rep`) → Waits for backtest row creation → Uploads to `upload-daily-summary` API → Moves to `done/` on success

#### File Processing Workflow
1. **Download Phase**: Job XML files downloaded to `jobs/to_do/`
2. **TSClient Processing**: TSClient processes XML files and generates results in monitored folders
3. **Upload Phase**: ClientGUI monitors result folders and uploads completed files
4. **Completion**: Files moved between status folders (to_do → done/error)
